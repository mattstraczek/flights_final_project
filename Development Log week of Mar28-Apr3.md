Development log week of Mar28-Apr3

**Goals for this week and whether they were accomplished**
1. Created development log organization
* Responsibility: Everyone
* Achieved? : YES
* Problems encountered during this process: no problem encountered


2. Created the first function for converting latitude and longitude data to cartesian coordinates to calculate the distance between two airports along the curvature of the Earth assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere. 
* Responsibility: Junryu
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: no problem encountered


3. Figure out what header files we will need for our project, and plan out what functions and instance variables will be included in these files, and what data types these instance variables should be. This includes getter and setter functions, our graph algorithms, and distance calculations.
* Responsibility: Luke
* Achieved?: YES Achieved writing out everything by hand in a notebook, but will write it in code and upload to GitHub at the beginning of next week.
* Problems encountered during this process: Figuring out what instance variables will be needed in the FlightPaths class, other than our adjacency matrix which will be used for the graph. 


**Plans for next week**
* Write out all the header files.
* Begin designing and complete the pseudocode for at least one of the algorithms.
