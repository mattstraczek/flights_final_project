**Contract**

1. **Team meetings**
 + The team should meet at least once a week in person to focus and touch base for the project. The team will meet every Tuesday at 8 PM at Grainger Library. 
 + The meeting time of the following week should be decided by Sunday 10pm, if class or other conflicts occur. 
 + Notes will be stored in a Google Doc, and the note-taker will rotate each week.
 + Note taker for the week will be responsible for submitting that week’s development log.

2. **Communication (Assistance)**
 + Communication should be done using either iMessage or Discord.
 + Make sure to be prompt in reply to ensure that your team members can work smoothly if someone in the team encounters a problem. 

3. **Roles (Respect)**
 + There will be a lead who’s job is to suggest the overall direction of the project. 
 + There will be a development logger who will track the progress of the team and the project as well as complete the development log. 
 + There will be two suggestions who will contribute possible next steps and tasks for the project to have smaller goals that will help us reach the final goal. 

4. **Time commitment**
 + Time commitment will be approximately 3 hours per week where 1-2 hours are in person meetings. The idea is that if we are really clear with what we need to do exactly, a lot could be accomplished during the meeting. 
 + If someone ends up working more than 5 hours during a week, the rest of the team members are expected to help resolve whatever issue is causing the high workload.

5. **Conflict resolution**
 + All delegation of work will be logged and if those goals are not met without prior notice to the team members, will receive strikes. 
 + There will be a grand total of 5 strikes which are not rebukable.
 + Majority votes will resolve conflicts.
