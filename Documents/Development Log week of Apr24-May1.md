Development log week of Apr24-May1


**Goals for this week and whether they were accomplished**
1. Geographic map output
* Responsibility: Junryu
* Achieved? : YES
* Problems encountered during this process: It was very difficult to come up with a method to project latitude and longitude data onto a 2D plane, with distortions of the map projection also needed to be considered. It required some trigonometry to ultimately come up with a really reliable way to project not only locations but the paths between two locations, which are drawn as curves that account for the curvature of the Earth. 


2. BFS 
* Responsibility: Luke Matt
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: There were many instances where we discovered infinite loops that were very hard to debug, especially with so many edges and nodes that are applicable. We had to break down the problems multiple times to understand. We also tried to change some of the properties of the edges so that it is better adapted to the overall fundamental change in our data structure of the adjacency list. 


3. Prim’s algorithm 
* Responsibility: Andrew Matt
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: No problems encountered




4. Start working on the final presentation
* Responsibility: Andrew Matt
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: No problems encountered




**Plans for next week**
* Finish off the test cases for each algorithm and readability of the code
* The presentation to describe our process needs to be finalized in the first half of the week
