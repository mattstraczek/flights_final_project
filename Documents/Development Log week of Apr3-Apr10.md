Development log week of Apr3-Apr10

**Goals for this week and whether they were accomplished**
1. Outlining all class structure and interdependencies
* Responsibility: Everyone
* Achieved?: YES, we all met up on tuesday to discuss how all classes should interact and depend on each other. We created a nice diagram that will be a physical road map for our projects. 
* Problems encountered during this process: To think of the most space efficient and run time efficient ways by taking out only necessary information and making sure no information is lost in the process. Designing classes and structures to accommodate the needs of different parts in the project took a while. Clash detections of some routes were required to overcome to make sure no redundancies are included in the project. 


2. Parsing class and basic structure of routes and airport classes
* Responsibility: Junryu and Luke
* Achieved? : YES
* Problems encountered during this process: No problems at all since we talked about it!


3. Hashmaps and creating the graph class 
* Responsibility: Matt and Andrew
* Achieved? : YES?
* Problems encountered during this process: Figuring out return types of certain functions. 


4. Project directory and compilation
* Responsibility: Matt
* Achieved? : YES
* Problems encountered during this process: Many bugs to tidy up due to a lot of raw, non-incremental programming already being done. However, the Makefile and compilation process are now created and working smoothly.
**Plans for next week**
* Start designing and implementing one of the algorithms, probably Prim’s algorithm. 
* Another pair may start research on the other algorithms.
