Development log week of Apr10-Apr17


**Goals for this week and whether they were accomplished**
1. Create test cases to ensure the Parsing class method, extractAirports, was functioning as intended and worked with both a simple file input and complex file input.
* Responsibility: Luke Boelke
* Achieved? : YES
* Problems encountered during this process: None


2. Create test cases for the adjacency matrix, and verify results from parsed data
* Responsibility: Matt
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: Some data that were loaded such as how the matrix was displayed for the test case had some minor bugs that took a while to decipher. 


3. Create test cases for parsing classes, specifically to output files and compare files
* Responsibility: Junryu
* Achieved?: Partially
* Problems encountered during this process: The file recognition didn’t work as planned. For efficiency, this method of test cases might be scrapped after further consultation. 


4. Decided on the general approach to DFS and Prim’s algorithm
* Responsibility: everyone
* Achieved?: YES
* Problems encountered during this process: none


Plans for next week
Continue with the test cases, ideally make sure the backbone classes test cases are complete so we can solely focus on the algorithms. We also decided to split up certain algorithms so we can better focus and split up work more efficiently.
